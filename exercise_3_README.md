Stack Demonstrations: I used Python lists to show LIFO behavior

Using given examples (UR labs, Irembo forms)
Built up to a challenge problem
Added my own reflection showing I understand WHY stacks work for undo/redo

Queue Demonstrations: I used deque for FIFO operations

Showed client/patient scenarios to connect theory to real life
Used popleft() to properly dequeue from the front

comparison of stach and queue

Same 5 fans, two different data structures
Stadium entry (stack) vs book distribution (queue)
Visually proves how LIFO reverses order while FIFO preserves it
