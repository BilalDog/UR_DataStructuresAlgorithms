# UR_DataStructuresAlgorithms
I decided that creating new values on each step would be too time consuming, so I defined a function to define the needed values in

after that each step of the task got its own function. in collab they can be run seperately

cant say much about integer part its just basic caluclations, len for the amount of items in the list

in stings I used zip to be able to combine lists or tuples
  i used enumerate to count inside the for loop insted of for ... in range and then i += 1
  
in booleans part i defined a target threshold wich shall be the the standard to reach 
  then i compared the results with the target
  
in lists i first created a copy so the original data is not changed
  then I added, removed and sorted the list
  I used pop for deletion because it also returns the value of the removed item, wich is usefull for outputs
  
in arrays I created the array and calculated the sum, I do not understand why. because the result is the same

dictionaries is the part wich took longest
  i decided to create the dictionairies inside a list so that each building does not have to be created manually
  after that i updated values
  deleted a building with pop
  then finally did calculations with the dictionairy values

Im sorry that I am not explaining each step of the code I created, it would take longer then the time it took to complete the code (3 hours)
