Exersice_1:
I decided that creating new values on each step would be too time consuming, so I defined a function to set the needed values in one step

After that each step of the task got its own function.

Can't say much about integer part its just basic caluclations, len for the amount of items in the list

In stings I used zip to be able to combine multiple lists or tuples
  I used enumerate to count inside the for loop insted of "for i in range" and then "i += 1"
  
In booleans part I defined a target threshold wich shall be the the standard to reach 
  then I compared the results with the target
  
In lists I first created a copy so the original data is not changed
  then I added, removed and sorted the list
  
In arrays I created the array and calculated the sum, the result is the same.

dictionaries is the part wich took longest
  I decided to create the dictionairies inside a list so that each building does not have to be created manually
  after that I updated values
  deleted a building
  then finally did calculations with the dictionairy values

Im sorry that I am not explaining each step of the code I created, if you have questions I'm happy to answer.
